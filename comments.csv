rr – record and replay debugger for C/C++,"I&#x27;ve been using rr for a while now, and it&#x27;s a game-changer for C&#x2F;C++ debugging on Linux. The deterministic replay and reverse execution features are incredibly powerful, especially for tracking down those elusive bugs. It&#x27;s like having a time machine for your code! Anyone else had experiences with rr making their debugging process smoother?"
rr – record and replay debugger for C/C++,"Is it truly only for C&#x2F;C++?<p>My limited understanding says a debugger needs: a list of symbols (.pdb files on windows, can&#x27;t remember what they are on linux), understanding of syscalls and a few other similar things. I thought they don&#x27;t care too much what generated the binaries they are debugging (obviously as long as it&#x27;s native code).<p>Doesn&#x27;t rr work with other languages like rust, zig, odin, nim, and similar ones? Obviously, I wouldn&#x27;t expect it to work for python, js, c# and other languages with managed memory."
rr – record and replay debugger for C/C++,"Perhaps worth mentioning is that someone attempted to port this to Rust and got about 60,000 lines of code into it before archiving the project. I feel like comparing these two efforts would be an interesting case study on the impacts &#x2F; benefits &#x2F; limitations or difficulties, etc involved in rewriting from C++ to Rust.<p><a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;sidkshatriya&#x2F;rd&#x2F;"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;sidkshatriya&#x2F;rd&#x2F;</a>"

rr – record and replay debugger for C/C++,"rr is really cool, but almost every time I have decided to pull it out as one of the &quot;big guns&quot; it turns out that I have a concurrency bug and so rr is unable to reproduce it.<p>Despite that, it would be very, very, very cool if some languages built rr directly into their tooling. Obviously you can always &quot;just&quot; use rr&#x2F;gdb, but imagine if rr invocations were as easy to set up and do as pdb is in Python!"
"What is the significance of the character ""j"" at the end of a Roman Numeral?","The Dutch digraph ij originated from the same custom. Originally written ii, later ij, and pronounced as a long i (English &quot;ee&quot;), the sound later shifted to be similar to English &quot;eye&quot;, see the Dutch names for the cities Berlijn and Parijs. Meanwhile, the long i sound is now written as ie. IJ is the only Dutch digraph that tends to be treated as a single letter and is capitalized as such. In education in the Netherlands it is taught as the 25th letter instead of y, which does not occur in native Dutch words, and in the phone book it used to be sorted together (mixed) with y. But since the advent of computers it is generally sorted as i followed by j. There are a few place names like Ysselsteyn where Y is pronounced as IJ."
"What is the significance of the character ""j"" at the end of a Roman Numeral?","Similar flourish to the &quot;long s&quot; once used in English to spell the &quot;ss&quot; gemination: <i>poſseſs</i> or <i>poſſeſs</i>.<p><a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Long_s"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Long_s</a>"
"What is the significance of the character ""j"" at the end of a Roman Numeral?",Looks like vim when I forget to map jk to escape.
"What is the significance of the character ""j"" at the end of a Roman Numeral?",Really interesting thanks for sharing. It&#x27;s great to learn these little things which would have been well known at one point but start to be forgotten as time and society progresses.
"What is the significance of the character ""j"" at the end of a Roman Numeral?","Seems Just like the letter -y at the end of a or Spanish (or English?) word is a glorified i, to make it more legible<p>Ley, rey, etc."
"What is the significance of the character ""j"" at the end of a Roman Numeral?","&gt; if all the letters i and J are not dotted, the pharmacist may be in doubt as to the number intended.<p>Oh, is that where &quot;dot the i&#x27;s and cross the t&#x27;s&quot; comes from? I can imagine that saying being hammered into many medical practitioners back then."
"What is the significance of the character ""j"" at the end of a Roman Numeral?",Now I wonder why pharmacists used roman numerals
"What is the significance of the character ""j"" at the end of a Roman Numeral?",Now i wonder if there&#x27;s a connection between j and ; as termination character.
"What is the significance of the character ""j"" at the end of a Roman Numeral?","Here I was hoping it was indicating a complex number, since i was already taken.<p>...on that note, how would one write complex numbers in Roman numerals, now that both i and j are taken?"
"What is the significance of the character ""j"" at the end of a Roman Numeral?",
"What is the significance of the character ""j"" at the end of a Roman Numeral?","&gt; A j was used for the final i, to make it clear the number had ended.<p>Yeah I imagined this was the case. Same as other common ways to avoid misunderstanding (and possible forgeries)"

Initial details about why CrowdStrike's CSAgent.sys crashed,"The moment I read &#x27;it is a <i>content update</i> that causes the BSOD, deleting it solves the problem&#x27;, I was immediately willing to bet a hundred quid (for the non-British, that&#x27;s £100) that it was a combination of said bad binary data and a poorly-written parser that didn&#x27;t error out correctly upon reading invalid data (in this case, read an array of pointers, didn&#x27;t verify that all of them were both non-null and pointed to valid data&#x2F;code).<p>In the past ten years or so of having done somewhat serious computing and zero cybersecurity whatsoever, I have my mind concluded, feel free to disagree.<p>Approximately <i>100%</i> of CVEs, crashes, bugs, slowdowns, and pain points of computing have to do with various forms of deserialising binary data back into machine-readable data structures. All because a) human programmers forget to account for edge cases, and b) imperative programming languages allow us to do so.<p>This includes everything from: decompression algorithms; font outline readers; image, video, and audio parsers; video game data parsers; XML and HTML parsers; the various certificate&#x2F;signature&#x2F;key parsers in OpenSSL (and derivatives); and now, this CrowdStrike content parser in its EDR program.<p>That wager stands, by the way, and I&#x27;m happy to up the ante by £50 to account for my second theory."
Initial details about why CrowdStrike's CSAgent.sys crashed,"The thing I don&#x27;t understand about all of this is another, much less technical and much more important.<p>Why the blas radius was so huge?<p>I have deployed much less important services much more slowly with automatic monitoring and rollback in place.<p>You first deploy to beta, where you don&#x27;t get customers traffic, if everything goes right to a small part of your fleet, and slowly increase the percentage of hosts that receives the updates.<p>This would have stopped the issue immediately, and I somehow I thought it was common practices..."
Initial details about why CrowdStrike's CSAgent.sys crashed,By-passing the discussion whether one actually needs root kit powered endpoint surveillance software such as CS perhaps an open-source solution would be a killer to move this whole sector to more ethical standards. So the main tool would be open source and it would be transparent what it does exactly and that it is free of backdoors or really bad bugs. It could be audited by the public. On the other hand it could still be a business model to supply malware signatures as a security team feeding this system.

Initial details about why CrowdStrike's CSAgent.sys crashed,"But how come they didn&#x27;t catch it in the testing deployments? what was the difference that caused it to happen when they deployed to the outside world. I find it hard to believe that they didn&#x27;t test it before deployment. I also think companies should all have a testing environment before deploying 3rd party components. I mean, we all install some packages during development that fails or cause some problems but nobody think it is a good idea to do it directly in their production environment before testing, so how is this different?"
Initial details about why CrowdStrike's CSAgent.sys crashed,Do these customers of crowd strike even have a say in these updates going out or do they all just bend over and let crowd strike have full RCE on every machine in their enterprise.<p>I sure hope the certificate authorities and other crypto folks get to keep that stuff off their systems at least.

Initial details about why CrowdStrike's CSAgent.sys crashed,"This is a pretty brief &#x27;analysis&#x27;. The poster traces back one stack frame in assembler, it basically amounts to just reading out a stack dump from gdb. It&#x27;s a good starting point I guess."
Initial details about why CrowdStrike's CSAgent.sys crashed,"A &#x27;channel file&#x27; is a file interpreted by their signature detection system. How far is this from a bytecode compiled domain specific language? Javascript anyone?<p>eBPF, much the same thing, is actually thought about and well designed. If it wasn&#x27;t it would be easy to crash linux.<p>This is what they do and they are doing badly. I bet it&#x27;s just shit on shit under the hood, developed by somewhat competent engineers, all gone or promoted to management."
Initial details about why CrowdStrike's CSAgent.sys crashed,"It&#x27;s really difficult to evaluate the risk the CrowdStrike system imposed. Was this a confluence of improbable events or an inevitable disaster waiting to happen?<p>Some still-open questions in my mind:<p>- was the broken rule in the config file (C-00000291-...32.sys) human authored and reviewed or machine-generated?<p>- was the config file syntactically or semantically invalid according to its spec?<p>- what is the intended failure mode of the kernel driver that encounters an invalid config (presumably it&#x27;s not &quot;go into a boot loop&quot;)?<p>- what automated testing was done on both the file going out and the kernel driver code? Where would we have expected to catch this bug?<p>- what release strategy, if any, was in place to limit the blast radius of a bug? Was there a bug in the release gates or were there simply no release gates?<p>Given what we know so far, it seems much more likely that this was a &quot;disaster waiting to happen&quot; but I still think there&#x27;s a lot more to know. I look forward to the public post-mortem."
Initial details about why CrowdStrike's CSAgent.sys crashed,"I wonder what privilege level this service runs at. If it&#x27;s less than ring 0, i think some blame needs to go to Windows itself.

Initial details about why CrowdStrike's CSAgent.sys crashed,"&#x27;Analysis&#x27; of the null pointer  is completely missing the point. The simple fact of the matter is they didnt do anywhere near enough testing before pushing the files out. Auto update comes with big responsibility, this was criminally reckless"
Initial details about why CrowdStrike's CSAgent.sys crashed,Really the underlying problem here is that their software is loading external data into their kernel driver and not correctly sanitising their inputs
Initial details about why CrowdStrike's CSAgent.sys crashed,"The girl on the supermarket checkout said she hoped her computer wouldn&#x27;t be affected.

Initial details about why CrowdStrike's CSAgent.sys crashed,"I see a paradox that the null bytes are &quot;not related&quot; to the current situation and yet deleting the file seems to cure the issue. Perhaps the CS official statement that &quot;This is not related to null bytes contained within Channel File 291 or any other Channel File.&quot; is poorly worded.<p>My opinion is that CS is trying to say the null bytes themselves aren&#x27;t the actual root cause of the issue, but merely a trigger for the actual root cause, which is that CSAgent.sys has a problem where malformed input vectors can cause it to crash. Well designed programs should error out gracefully for foreseeable errors, like corrupted config files.<p>If we interpret that quoted sentence such that &quot;this&quot; is referring to &quot;the logical error&quot;, and that &quot;the logical error&quot; is the error in CSAgent.sys that causes it to crash upon reading a bad channel file, then that statement makes sense.<p>This is a bit of a stretch, but so far my impression with CS corporate communication regarding this issue has been nothing but abject chaos, so this is totally on-brand for them."
Initial details about why CrowdStrike's CSAgent.sys crashed,"How sure are we, that this was not a cyberattack?<p>It seems really scary to me, that crowdstrike is able to push updates in real time to most of their customers systems. I don&#x27;t know of any other system, that would provide a similar method to inject code at kernel level. Not even windows updates, as they always roll out with some delay and not to all computers at the same time<p>If you want to attack high profile systems, crowdstrike would be one of the best possible targets."

Minuteman missile communications,"Coincidentally, I just toured the South Dakota minuteman launch control facility this week [1] and it was fascinating.  The park ranger giving the tour was a veteran who manned the facility decades ago — amazing stories. You need to book tickets a few months in advance but well worth it if you’re in the area to visit Badlands, Mt. Rushmore, etc.<p>[1] Run by U.S. National Park Service: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nps.gov&#x2F;mimi&#x2F;"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nps.gov&#x2F;mimi&#x2F;</a>"
Minuteman missile communications,"&gt; Various options including DSL over HICS cables and radio were considered, but the current plan is to trench new fiber-optic cables across the launch fields. They&#x27;re less interesting, but fiber optic cables have both capacity and reliability advantages over telephone cables, and could easily remain in service for the life of the Sentinel program.<p>I was actually a bit surprised there was nothing about lightning and EMP suppression. I’m no expert on EMP effects, but multiple-mile-long cable loops underground seem like the kind of thing that would develop large induced currents in the presence of a varying magnetic field.<p>Nonconductive fiber optic cables are entirely immune to these effects.  And they’re less expensive than copper!"

Minuteman missile communications,my dad was a pm for this stuff. i have no idea what he did as he retired by the time i was 8 (92) but this was his world.<p>anyone know anything else about this stuff? i’ve often considered trying to recreate his career path. (he died about 5 years ago.)
Minuteman missile communications,Interesting article. I have always been curious about how weapons systems like missiles communicate with command and control systems. Especially how the datalinks worked on cold war era systems. Not a lot of info out there. So this article was a good read.

Minuteman missile communications,Crazy that the communication system doesn&#x27;t seem to be that much more advanced than tin cans and a string when compared to modern day. Guess the same can be said for the weapons themselves.
